Final Testing

Figure out hosting


Setup:
    Ask for new role for me and the bot
    Get access to/ID's for admin bot channel and regular bot channels
    Bot needs access to these + recruitment, nothing else
    Get ID's for Admin role/whatever other role they want to be able to add new relics

    Bot needs following permissions in those channels:
        Read messages
        Send messages
        Manage messages
        Read message history
        Add reactions





Possible expansion:
Make "create" command respond to any message that isn't a command instead
Squad forming
Mass ping using global list
    automatically starts pinging when new users are added
    new players to ping are just added to the list
Automatically make/delete a certain number of roles for most popular relics
