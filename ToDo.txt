Plans to make:
Create list of commands to reimplement
Create list of events to reimplement
    RAW going to be a problem?
Transfer over old ToDo list
 
Features to think about:
Look into remote terminal things
    Public ok? 
    Just put all logs on the server?
Figure out whether to use old database or start from scratch
Basic command for changing baseConfig parameters
    Figure out things to be in config
    permsConfig/channelConfig too (different commands?)
Commands for changing other configs e.g. bot channels/permissions
    Something to reload permissions?
    Reload certain config files? Or just overwrite on client?
Star-board/vote to pin
Mute list/command

Things to do:
Learn GitHub stuff
    Google drive?
    Ignore folder with identity stuff
Actually learn how the SQL stuff works
Help on individual commands
    Ping first (for experimentation)
Get help command to list possible commands for your permission level
    Pass permission level to command help file?
    Don't show commands with no help info
