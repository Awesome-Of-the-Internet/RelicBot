create command
take first argument as squad type (1b1, 2b2, 4b4)
every arg after that becomes a string


Create empty string/array to add things to
Create relicArray
Force string to lower case

Index, starting at 0
If character at index is opening square bracket
	Set ignore to true
If ignore is true
	If character is close square bracket
		Set ignore to false
	If character is final character in string
		Error message saying that there weren't enough closing brackets

currentCharacter = index
If ignore is false
	Check if next few characters are "lith, meso, neo, axi"
		(currentCharacter should then be set to the character after these)

		If currentCharacter is a letter and character after is a number (OR current is a space, letters AFTER that match this
			Get all the connected numbers after that as well (don't move currentCharacter)
			Look up relic, if exists
				Add relic to relicArray
				set currentCharacter to character after that number
				Add character at index (comma, space or bracket) to newString
				Add some kind of formatting "__**"
				Add relic name to newString
				Finish formatting "**__"
			Otherwise (not existing relic)
				currentCharacter = index after the last number
				Display message that relic was found but doesn't exist
		Otherwise (relic era found, but format of name is incorrect)
			currentCharacter = index after era
			Display message - era detected but incorrect identifier

set index to currentCharacter (skips the detected relic name or bad names)
If currentCharacter < index, add everything between them (including index) to newString (somehow exclude square brackets?)
index++

After: Check if any relics were found using relicArray, return error otherwise



Should account for errors:
mixed cases
lack of spaces between characters
incorrect relic names (have lith but bad id)
relics that don't exist
Anything that would somehow break but is enclosed in square brackets instead
should preserve brackets, commas, spaces
